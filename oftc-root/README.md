# POC for including Svelte components via different approaches

In this project we build a host application (this repo) with Sveltekit that uses Svelte components from other projects/ repos via 3 different approaches:
1. module federation
2. npm modules
3. git submodules

This is to ensure the scalability of the base project in the future.

## Next steps
* create a Svelte project & repo and integrate it to this host project via module federation
* implement a basic navigation with the layout engine from Sveltekit
